# MURAKAS
MURAKAS is my first attempt of prototyping a device,  PCB design and logging the processes to make a device network with uses low power and has a long range.

# MURAKAS V2
V2 is the second revision of prototype device communication system based on LoRa. I have learned of the mistakes of V1 and advanced the design.
