# MURAKAS
MURAKAS is my first attempt of prototyping a device,  PCB design and logging the processes to make a device network with uses low power and has a long range. 

Name is acronym in Estonian: Maas Ulatuv Raadiosidega vArustatud Keskne Andurite Süsteem

# MURAKAS V1
V1 is the first idea on paper. I used an Arduino pro mini and a LoRa rfm95 to test the concept. Due to LoRa rfm95´s smaller pin header, I decided to also make my first PCB.
V1 proved that this system is possible and works.
Sender a receiver codes are LoRa library example codes.
PCB files of V1 are not available due to lack of skill when design it, and I think that you can make a better design if you want to replicate this system.
