# MURAKAS
MURAKAS is my first attempt of prototyping a device,  PCB design and logging the processes to make a device network with uses low power and has a long range.

# MURAKAS V1
V1 is the first idea on paper. I used an Arduino pro mini and a LoRa rfm95 to test the concept. Due to LoRa rfm95Â´s smaller pin header, I decided to also make my first PCB.
V1 proved that this system is possible and works.
Sender a receiver codes are LoRa library example codes
PCB files to V1 are not available due to lack of skill when design it and I think that you can make a better design.
