# MURAKAS
MURAKAS is my first attempt of prototyping a device,  PCB design and logging the processes to make a device network with uses low power and has a long range.

Name is acronym in Estonian: Maas Ulatuv Raadiosidega vArustatud Keskne Andurite SÃ¼steem

# MURAKAS V2
V2 is the second revision of prototype device communication system based on LoRa. I have learned of the mistakes of V1 and advanced the design.
In V2 I used Atmega328p as an alternative to Arduino pro mini. This enabled me to go smaller and use less energy.
